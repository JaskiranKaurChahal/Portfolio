<h2>About Me</h2> 
<p>Hello everyone! </p>
<p>My name is Jaskiran Kaur Chahal and I am from Punjab, India. 
Currently, I'm  pursuing my studies in Computer Engineering and Technicin program at Northern College of Applied Arts and Technology. 
My ultimate goal is to carve a career in the dynamic field of cybersecurity, where I can protect digital landscapes from emerging threats. 
Beyond my studies, I have a deep passion for art, particularly painting, which is my cherished hobby. 
Cooking is my another pastime I adore, where I like to serve tasty and nutrious food to my loved ones. 
I look forward to a future where I can merge my love for technology with my artistic endeavors, making a meaningful impact in both realms.
