    <h3>Website 1</h3>
    <p style="color: orangered;">This website is based on Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji who was the founder of Sikhism and is the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. 
  He was born on April 15, 1469, in Talwandi, a village in the Punjab (present-day Pakistan). 
  Guru Nanak's teachings emphasized the oneness of God, equality of all humans, and the importance of selfless service and devotion.</p>

  <h3>Website 4</h3>
  <p style="color: orangered;">The world's largest community kitchen is associated with the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, India. 
    The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is the holiest Sikh shrine and a place of immense spiritual significance for Sikhs around the world.
 Langar (referred to as food) in the community kitchen operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and serves millions of people free meals who visits the Golden Temple, regardless of their religion, caste, creed, or social status. 
 This tradition of serving free meals to all, regardless of their background, reflects one of the core principles of Sikhism: equality and selfless service.</p>
